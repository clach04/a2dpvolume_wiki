I copied the LNotifications sample app and added the ability to invoke car mode for testing.  It is rough but can be useful.  Download the APK here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2ZRdduGQB59dFZnUTkxQXgxdm8

The way I use it is open the LNotifications app and invoke car mode.  Then you can use car mode in A2DP Volume to set up actions such as reading notifications.  This will put A2DP Volume in connected more with car mode settings.

When you invoke car mode your device will change the homescreen UI to the car mode homescreen.  Some devices don't have one so if you try to go home you will get strange behavior.  Use the recent apps button in Android (the right boxes) to navigate back to the LNotificationsSample app and toggle the car mode button to get back out of car mode.  

This app is only useful for testing.  It is rough so don't expect great things.  Here is the sample app I modified: https://developer.android.com/samples/LNotifications/index.html
