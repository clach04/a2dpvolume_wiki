# Get started

Here are the basic steps to get the app working for you.
1. Before using this app you must pair all the Bluetooth devices you plan to use.  Do this with Android settings (A2DP Volume does not handle paring).
2. Open A2DP Volume and click [Find Devices] button at the top.  A list of devices should appear below.  This list will include virtual devices such as "car dock" based on your selections in the app preferences.
3. Click on each device in the list, then click the [Edit] button in the dialog that appears. Make your selections for each device and click [save] at the bottom.  

That will get basic volume control, location capture, and the other features shown the the edit device screens started.
